I have an assignment to create a form page for both mobile and desktop mode. I am almost done with the desktop mode, 
but I don't know how to put error messages on the input fields...just as illustrated in "active-states" picture in this file.


Please, help me add the error messages

I also need help making the mobile version of the form page.

Thanks in advance.
